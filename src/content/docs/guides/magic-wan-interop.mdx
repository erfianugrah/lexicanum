### Step 1: Conduit Configuration

This would be setup during the onboarding with Cloudflare, the setup would require specific information from your end w.r.t specific subnets that should be upgraded or if you want to use non RFC 1918 prefixes.

### Step 2: GRE and/or IPsec Tunnel Prerequisites

To avoid performance issues caused by packet fragmentation, it's essential to correctly calculate the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) based on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and any encapsulation overhead.

- **MTU to MSS Calculation:** The fundamental relationship between MTU and MSS for standard TCP/IP traffic is:

  <LatexBlock
    math={`MSS = MTU - (\\mathrm{IP\\ Header} + \\mathrm{TCP\\ Header})`}
  />
  <LatexBlock
    math={`MSS = MTU - (20\\ \\mathrm{bytes} + 20\\ \\mathrm{bytes}) = MTU - 40\\ \\mathrm{bytes}`}
  />

- **Standard Internet Values:**
  - **Ethernet MTU:** 1500 bytes -> **MSS:** 1460 bytes
  - **PPPoE MTU:** 1492 bytes (due to 8-byte PPPoE header) -> **MSS:** 1452 bytes

#### GRE

Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) adds a new IP header and a GRE header.

- **New IP Header:** 20 bytes
- **GRE Header:** 4 bytes
- **Total GRE Overhead:** 24 bytes

**Example Calculation for GRE over a standard 1500 MTU link:**

1.  **Effective Tunnel MTU:** $1500 - 24 = 1476$ bytes
2.  **Optimal MSS:** $1476 - 40 = 1436$ bytes

| Standard Internet Routable MTU   | 1500 bytes     |
| :------------------------------- | :------------- |
| - Original IP header             | 20 bytes       |
| - Original protocol header (TCP) | 20 bytes       |
| - New IP header                  | 20 bytes       |
| - New protocol header (GRE)      | 4 bytes        |
| **= Maximum segment size (MSS)** | **1436 bytes** |

#### IPsec

The overhead for IPsec's Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is variable and depends on the encryption and integrity algorithms used. It includes a new IP header, ESP header, Initialization Vector (IV), and trailer/authenticator.

A conservative estimate for a common suite like **AES-CBC with SHA-256** can be up to **77 bytes**. More efficient modern ciphers like **AES-GCM** have a fixed overhead around **54 bytes**.

| Cipher Suite             | Mode   | New IP Header | ESP Header | IV Size | Padding Range | Trailer | ICV | Total Overhead Range |
| :----------------------- | :----- | :------------ | :--------- | :------ | :------------ | :------ | :-- | :------------------- |
| AES-256-CBC with SHA-256 | Tunnel | 20            | 8          | 16      | 0-15          | 2       | 16  | **62-77**            |
| AES-256-GCM              | Tunnel | 20            | 8          | 8       | 0-3           | 2       | 16  | **54-57**            |
| 3DES-CBC with SHA-1      | Tunnel | 20            | 8          | 8       | 0-7           | 2       | 12  | **50-57**            |

**Note**: Overhead varies based on padding requirements. AES-CBC uses 16-byte blocks requiring padding to align payload. AES-GCM uses 4-byte alignment. Use the maximum values for conservative MSS calculations.

**Example Calculation for IPsec (AES-GCM) over a 1500 MTU link:**

1.  **Effective Tunnel MTU:** $1500 - 54 = 1446$ bytes
2.  **Optimal MSS:** $1446 - 40 = 1406$ bytes

#### **MSS Clamping Implementation**

MSS clamping ensures TCP connections use an appropriate MSS value regardless of what endpoints advertise:

**iptables (Linux):**

```sh
# For GRE tunnels
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -o tun0 -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1436

# For IPsec tunnels
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -o vti0 -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1350

# Auto-clamp to PMTU
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
```

**nftables (Linux):**

```sh
table ip mangle {
    chain forward {
        type filter hook forward priority -150;
        oifname "tun0" tcp flags syn tcp option maxseg size set 1436
        oifname "vti0" tcp flags syn tcp option maxseg size set 1350
    }
}
```

#### Diagnostic Commands and Workflow

Do not rely on theoretical values alone. Use the following commands to discover the real-world path limitations and verify your settings.

#### **Step 1: Discover the Path MTU with `ping`**

Use an iterative `ping` test to find the largest packet size that can traverse a path without fragmentation. This is done by setting the "Don't Fragment" (DF) bit and adjusting the packet size.

**Important:** The size parameter in `ping` specifies the ICMP _payload_. The total packet size is the payload plus 28 bytes (20-byte IP header + 8-byte ICMP header).

**Linux Command:**

```sh
# From behind tunnel, test to remote endpoint
ping -M do -s 1400 <REMOTE_PRIVATE_IP>

# Gradually increase packet size to find maximum
for size in 1400 1420 1440 1460 1472; do
    echo "Testing size $size:"
    ping -c 2 -M do -s $size <REMOTE_IP>
done

ping <DESTINATION_IP> -M -s 1500
```

- `-M do`: Sets the Don't Fragment bit.
- `-s <payload_size>`: Sets the ICMP payload size in bytes.

**Windows Command:**

```sh
ping <DESTINATION_IP> -f -l <payload_size>
```

- `-f`: Sets the Don't Fragment bit.
- `-l <payload_size>`: Sets the ICMP payload size in bytes.

**MacOS Command:**

```sh
ping -D -s <payload_size> <DESTINATION_IP>
```

- `-D`: Sets the Don't Fragment bit
- `-s <payload_size>`: Sets the ICMP payload size in bytes

**Methodology:**

1.  Start with a large payload size, like 1472 (for a 1500-byte packet).
2.  If you get a "Frag needed and DF set" or "Packet needs to be fragmented" error, the packet is too large.
3.  Decrease the `<payload_size>` by 8 or 10 bytes and repeat until the ping is successful.
4.  The Path MTU is the largest successful `<payload_size>` + 28 bytes. For example, if 1464 is the largest successful payload, your Path MTU is $1464 + 28 = 1492$ bytes.

#### **Step 2: Verify TCP MSS with `tcpdump`**

The MSS value is advertised during the three-way TCP handshake. Use `tcpdump` to capture the initial SYN packets and inspect the MSS option.[1, 16]

- **Command to Capture SYN Packets:**

```sh
sudo tcpdump -i <INTERFACE> 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0'
sudo tcpdump -i <INTERFACE> 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn)!=0 and dst port [443 or 80]
```

This filter is precise, capturing only packets where the SYN flag is set.

**Example Output Analysis:**

```sh
09:47:29.132309 IP [MY_IP].[REDACTED_ISP].53958 > 162.159.138.105.https: Flags [S], seq 471050517, win 64240, options [mss 1452,nop,wscale 8,nop,nop,sackOK], length 0
```

With IPsec, `10.68.100.20` is the tunnel endpoint on my side of the tunnel:

```sh
09:49:19.268016 IP 10.68.100.20.51678 > 104.16.236.133.https: Flags [S], seq 2995991175, win 32120, options [mss 1350,sackOK,TS val 1792385600 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0:
```

:::note
The key information is `mss 1350`, which confirms the Maximum Segment Size being advertised by the source host. This is invaluable for confirming that MSS clamping configurations on a firewall or router are working as intended.
:::

### Step 3: Configure your [tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/) and [static routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-static-routes/) on Cloudflare

- Create a [vti](https://docs.strongswan.org/docs/5.9/features/routeBasedVpn.html#XFRM-Interfaces-on-Linux) with a /31 subnet for use, refer to your vendor documentation on how to create one
- The Cloudflare endpoint will be provided to you via the conduit configuration yaml
- The Customer endpoint would be the IP provided to you via your ISP
- By default, you can only add [static routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-static-routes/) with [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) IP prefixes like:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/12
  - 192.168.0.0/16

There are exceptions for publicly routable addresses, inform your friendly (at this point) implementation manager before the project begins.

### Step 4: Make sure [health-checks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/tunnel-health-checks/) work

You should start seeing Cloudflare's side of the tunnel hitting yours (health wise, take an average as not all data centers pinging your end of the tunnel matters):

```sh
10:05:07.160315 IP 10.68.100.21 > 10.68.100.20: ICMP echo request, id 7295, seq 0, length 64
10:05:07.160378 IP 10.68.100.20 > 10.68.100.21: ICMP echo reply, id 7295, seq 0, length 64
10:05:07.169088 IP 10.68.100.21 > 10.68.100.20: ICMP echo request, id 63043, seq 0, length 64
10:05:07.169150 IP 10.68.100.20 > 10.68.100.21: ICMP echo reply, id 63043, seq 0, length 64
10:05:07.208415 IP 10.68.100.21 > 10.68.100.20: ICMP echo request, id 41057, seq 0, length 64
10:05:07.208498 IP 10.68.100.20 > 10.68.100.21: ICMP echo reply, id 41057, seq 0, length 64
10:05:07.238198 IP 10.68.100.21 > 10.68.100.20: ICMP echo request, id 17771, seq 0, length 64
```

If you have `replay-window` enabled, make sure [anti-replay protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/reference/anti-replay-protection/) is enabled on Cloudflare's side.

### Step 5: Route the private subnets to your `vti`

:::caution

Check your `sysctl` configuration for linux kernels.

It is possible that you might need to set these values:

```sh
# Enable IP forwarding (required for routing)
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Configure reverse path filtering based on your topology:
# For symmetric routing (recommended):
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1

# For asymmetric routing or complex topologies:
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=2
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.<VTI_INTERFACE>.rp_filter=2

# For advanced routing scenarios with local addresses:
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_local=1

# Make persistent by adding to /etc/sysctl.d/99-magic-wan.conf:
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-magic-wan.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 2
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_local = 1
EOF

# Apply changes
sudo sysctl --system
```

`For rp_filter`:

- 0 - No source validation.
- 1 - Strict mode as defined in RFC3704 Strict Reverse Path Each incoming packet is tested against the FIB and if the interface is not the best reverse path the packet check will fail. By default failed packets are discarded.
- 2 - Loose mode as defined in RFC3704 Loose Reverse Path Each incoming packet’s source address is also tested against the FIB and if the source address is not reachable via any interface the packet check will fail.

Current recommended practice in RFC3704 is to enable strict mode to prevent IP spoofing from DDoS attacks. **If using asymmetric routing or other complicated routing, then loose mode is recommended.**

- [Palo Alto Networks NGFW](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/palo-alto/)
- [pfSense](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/pfsense/)
- [SonicWall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/sonicwall/)
- [Sophos Firewall](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/sophos-firewall/)
- [strongSwan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/strongswan/)
- [VyOS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/vyos/)

You can do a TCP `traceroute` to see if it's going via the tunnel to another endpoint that's also exposed via Magic WAN:

```sh
sudo traceroute -T 172.18.0.8
traceroute to 172.18.0.8 (172.18.0.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.68.69.1 (10.68.69.1)  0.627 ms  0.460 ms  0.480 ms
 2  10.68.100.21 (10.68.100.21)  5.833 ms  5.289 ms  5.264 ms
 3  172.71.93.32 (172.71.93.32)  7.644 ms  7.038 ms  10.645 ms
 4  172.18.0.8 (172.18.0.8)  10.356 ms  10.562 ms  10.244 ms
```

### Step 6: Automate your provisioning through the use of Gitops/IaC

This can be done via the UI, API or via Terraform. However, it is recommended to use infrastructure as code as much as possible. The examples make use of [`.tfvars`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files) file and a [`variables.tf`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#declaring-an-input-variable) file to reference those sensitive values when applying or planning the infrastructure with Terraform. There are many ways to go about securing the sensitive information including the `.tfstate` file such as encrypting with [`Mozilla SOPS`](https://github.com/getsops/sops) and [`Age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age).

  name        = "Magic WAN Firewall"
  description = "Default Magic WAN Firewall"

  rules = [
    {
      action      = "allow"
      expression  = "(ip.proto eq \"icmp\")"
      description = "Allow ICMP"
      enabled     = "true"
    },
    {
      action      = "allow"
      expression  = "(ip.src in {100.64.0.0/10})"
      description = "Allow WARP Virtual IPs"
      enabled     = "true"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 7: Interoperability (Optional)

:::danger
**Critical Limitations and Requirements**

**Account Architecture**

- **WARP Connector and Magic WAN cannot coexist in the same Cloudflare account** due to conduit configuration conflicts

**Virtual Networks Requirements**

- **Cloudflare Tunnel + Magic WAN**: Virtual Networks are REQUIRED when handling overlapping IP ranges
- **WARP + Magic WAN**: Use default Virtual Network for connectivity
- **WARP Connector**: Does NOT require Virtual Networks configuration (uses default)

**DH Group for IPsec Tunnels**

- Supported: Groups 5 (1536-bit MODP), 14 (2048-bit MODP), 20 (384-bit ECP)
- Recommended: Group 20 for optimal security
- Limitation: Only ONE DH group can be active per account

**Double Encapsulation Prevention**

- **Issue**: WARP traffic transiting Magic WAN locations causes double encapsulation
- **Solution (as of Sept 2024)**: Magic WAN Connector automatically routes WARP traffic to Internet
- **Manual Fix**: Exclude WARP Ingress IPs (162.159.137.104, 162.159.138.104) and UDP ports (500, 1701, 2408, 4500) in routing policies

**Cloudflare Tunnel Limitations**

- **No outbound connections**: Cloudflare Tunnel is ingress-only
- **Route priority**: Cloudflare Tunnel routes take precedence over Magic WAN static routes (for now)
- **Workaround**: Use WARP Connector for bidirectional requirements

**WARP Connector Beta Status**

- Currently Linux-only deployment
- Cannot be deployed in Magic WAN-enabled accounts
- Requires manual IP forwarding and MSS clamping configuration
- Not recommended for production workloads

#### PAC File (Proxy Endpoints)

There are many ways to deploy the PAC file such as MDMs and using a remote server, in this case, I'll be using [Workers](https://github.com/erfianugrah/worker-proxy-pac). You can follow the steps [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/pac-files/), when using the code, you can create more cases to match specific files, in my case it is nl.pac and sg.pac to simulate the two locations, I also used [Workers Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) to store the Proxy Endpoint domains:

##### PAC File Worker Deployment

###### Worker entrypoint (index.js)

```js
import { nl_pac_file, sg_pac_file } from "./pac_file.js";

export default {
  fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/nl.pac") {
      return nl_pac_file(env);
    } else if (url.pathname === "/sg.pac") {
      return sg_pac_file(env);
    } else {
      return new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
    }
  },
};
```

###### PAC File variables (pac_file.js)

```js
export function nl_pac_file(env) {
  const nl = `

#### WARP/Clientless RBI

With WARP, the [managed](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/) deployment approach is recommended as you can ensure that not only you're managing the devices and the policies but also the WARP client itself. This can also be managed through the use of [Device Profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/). If the use case is to connect to endpoints behind Cloudflare Tunnel or Magic WAN, select the `default` [Virtual Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/) in the client's dropdown menu.

Both WARP (you can also isolate applications) and [Clientless RBI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/#clientless-web-isolation) would use the same Access application and policy as shown below, and both would allow the user to access private IP applications via the other on-ramps.

#### Cloudflare Tunnel

Tunnels are used to exposed private applications or for connectivity in the case of RDP, SSH, VNC and the like, it does not support bi-directional traffic as mentioned above. By setting up the routes, you can now reach those same private applications behind Cloudflare Tunnel be it from a PAC file, clientless RBI, WARP or behind Magic WAN.

:::note

**Cloudflare Tunnel Deployment**

There are (again) like WARP many ways to deploy, as systemd on a VM or metal, docker standalone or in compose or a deployment in k8s or docker swarm.

Be aware of the system requirements:

For most use cases, we recommend the following baseline configuration:

- Run a cloudflared replica on two dedicated host machines per network location. Using two hosts enables server-side redundancy and traffic balancing.
- Size each host with minimum 4GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores.
- Allocate 50,000 ports to the cloudflared process on each host.

This setup is usually sufficient to handle traffic from 8,000 WARP users (4,000 per host). The actual amount of resources used by cloudflared will depend on many variables, including the number of requests per second, bandwidth, network path and hardware. As additional users are onboarded, or if network traffic increases beyond your existing tunnel capacity, you can scale your tunnel by adding an additional cloudflared host in that location.

#### (Beta) WARP Connector

It shares the same functionality as Cloudflare Tunnel does but with bidirectional support. This means that only you can expose private services/applications which require two-way traffic such as communication services.

As the WARP connector is also essentially a device connected via WARP to the internet, a remote user with WARP connectivity can also connect to it directly and not just the services exposed behind it which is what we call WARP-to-WARP connectivity. Both site-to-site and peer-to-peer use cases work here, similar to Magic WAN.

##### Site-to-site Connectivity

1. Setup Access policy for WARP enrolment (this would be the same policy for WARP authentication), since it's site-to-site, we will have to deploy it via `.xml` with the required parameters.

Refer to [service tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/) and [device enrolment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/) for details.

2. Setup the `split tunnel` to either `include` or `exclude` mode, in this example, I have chosen `exclude` so that I can still SSH into the nodes to showcase the functionality.

Since this portion can be managed by Terraform, this is the example HCL:

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_split_tunnel" "default_include" {
  account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
  policy_id  = cloudflare_device_settings_policy.default.id
  mode       = "exclude"
  tunnels {
    address     = "10.68.69.3"
    description = "ERFI1"
  }
  tunnels {
    address     = "10.68.73.3"
    description = "arch-0"
  }
  tunnels {
    address     = "10.68.73.2"
    description = "pve"
  }
}
```

3. Ensure these settings are enabled:

- Enable CGNAT routing (Settings -> Network)
  - Enable Proxy (UDP, TCP, ICMP)
  - Enable WARP to WARP
  - Override local interface IP (Settings -> WARP Client)
    - If in `include` mode, ensure `100.96.0.0/12` is included

Some of these settings are available as a Terraform resource (as shown below), since it would be a mix a of API/UI and Terraform, Terraform would not know the state, so just keep to API/UI for all settings.

```terraform
resource "cloudflare_teams_account" "miau3" {
  account_id                             = var.cloudflare_account_id
  tls_decrypt_enabled                    = false
  protocol_detection_enabled             = false
  activity_log_enabled                   = true
  non_identity_browser_isolation_enabled = true

  body_scanning {
    inspection_mode = "deep"
  }

  antivirus {
    enabled_download_phase = false
    enabled_upload_phase   = false
    fail_closed            = false
  }

  fips {
    tls = false
  }

  proxy {
    tcp     = true
    udp     = true
    root_ca = true
  }

  url_browser_isolation_enabled = true

  logging {
    redact_pii = false
    settings_by_rule_type {
      dns {
        log_all    = true
        log_blocks = false
      }
      http {
        log_all    = true
        log_blocks = false
      }
      l4 {
        log_all    = true
        log_blocks = false
      }
    }
  }

  extended_email_matching {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

4. Set up the WARP Connector

- Either via API or the UI, create the WARP connector (currently not available as a Terraform resource):

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/account_id/warp_connector \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Auth-Email: ' \
  --data '{
  "name": "arch-0"
}'
```

Upon creation, you will get the example `.xml` e.g. which will look like this:

```xml
<dict>
 <key>organization</key>
 <string>org_name</string>
 <key>auth_client_id</key>
 <string>client_access_id_string</string>
 <key>auth_client_secret</key>
 <string>client_access_secret_string</string>
 <key>warp_connector_token</key>
 <string>connector_token_string</string>
</dict>
```

This is what you will place in the `/var/lib/cloudflare-warp` directory after the WARP client install. Refer to the relevant [repositories](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/) that matches your Linux distribution, for Arch, you would have to install via [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cloudflare-warp-bin).

Once done, if not yet enabled, run `sudo systemctl enable warp-svc` then `sudo systemctl start warp-svc`, if already running as a service, run `sudo systemctl restart warp-svc` so that it will use the new configuration to connect to Cloudflare.

5. Set up Linux networking

We need to enable IP forwarding and MSS clamping (WARP's MTU is 1280 bytes).

Create a `.conf` file in the `etc/sysctl.d/` directory with value of `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1` so that this persists upon reboot.

To check what IPtables rules are existing, we can run `sudo iptables-save > test.conf` to just see what's currently being use, if all's well. We can add the following to the existing `/etc/iptables/iptables.rules` file, such that it would look something like this:

```sh
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A FORWARD -i CloudflareWARP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
-A FORWARD -o CloudflareWARP -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
COMMIT
```

This would make sure the MSS clamping rules will also persist on reboot.

6. Route nodes/VMs/containers to the WARP connector

The most common use case here would either be an alternate gateway to the main router or an intermediate gateway. In this example, I will be using it as an intermediate gateway.

Set up the `static routes` for each WARP connector, the configuration will be similar to the `Cloudflare Tunnel` routes. In our case, on the WARP connector called `arch-1`, we will exposing `10.68.73.102/32` for the `arch-2` machine, and `arch-3` will be exposing `10.68.73.104/32` for `arch-4` machine.

Let's use `arch-2` as an example as the same steps will be replicated on the other node.

Run:

```sh
ip route
```

and you should be able to see default routes, for instance:

```sh
default via 10.68.73.1 dev ens18 proto dhcp src 10.68.73.102 metric 100
```

we want to create another route that has higher precedence than this (lower number).

Run:

```sh
sudo ip route add default via 10.68.73.101 dev ens18 metric 99
```

What this means is that, traffic from `arch-2` will go via the `ens18` interface to `10.68.73.101` which is the WARP connector `arch-1` and using it as a gateway, now this node is connected to Cloudflare.

Do the same for the other node, and change the IP.

Run:

```sh
curl https://icanhazip.com
```

on either machine, and you should be able to see a Cloudflare IP, just be aware since all traffic is sent to the WARP connector, that the DNS server used by the machines routed to WARP connector can be accessed while on the network, either by another route or a public DNS server.

```sh
curl icanhazip.com
104.28.218.39
```

7. Route the machines to each other

We can either router the entire prefix to the WARP connector or specific IPs, in my case, I will be using just one IP:

```sh
sudo ip route add 10.68.73.104 via 10.68.73.101 dev ens18 metric 98
```

This will allow `10.68.73.102` to reach `10.68.73.104`, do the same on `arch-4`, just by swapping the IPs, from `.104` to `.102`

Run:

```sh
ping 10.68.73.102
```

or

```sh
mtr 10.68.73.102
```

and vice versa to see the traffic reach the WARP connector CGNAT IP before reaching the other machine.
